                <p> Academic Advising is a process where students envision, execute, and reflect on their academic plans with guidance from a qualified UMSI Academic Advisor. Students share their goals, challenges, and questions with their academic advisor, and their academic advisor contributes knowledge of university and program requirements, policies, and processes.</p>
